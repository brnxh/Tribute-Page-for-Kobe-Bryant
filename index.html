                Kobe Bean Bryant was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers 
                in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

            <p>
                In his second season with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest All-Star in NBA history at 19. 
                The shooting guard then teamed up with superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships and was voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-2004. 
                Although the Lakers struggled after O'Neal left in 2004, Bryant performed brilliantly. He scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006, second-highest single-game mark in NBA history, 
                and led the league in scoring that year and the next. In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. 
                In the NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship. The following year, the Lakers won their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.
